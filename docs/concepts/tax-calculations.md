# How Tax Calculations Work

The honest truth about Malaysian tax, explained simply (because tax is complicated enough).

## The Big Picture

When you run a business in Malaysia, you pay tax. How much depends on:
1. **Your structure**: Enterprise (Sole Prop) vs Sdn Bhd (Private Limited)
2. **Your profit**: How much money you make
3. **Your expenses**: What you can deduct
4. **Your reliefs**: Tax breaks you qualify for

This calculator compares both structures side-by-side so you can see which one leaves more money in your pocket.

## Personal Income Tax (Enterprise/Sole Prop)

### How It Works

If you're an Enterprise (Sole Proprietorship), your business profit is treated as **personal income**. You pay personal income tax on it.

**The Process:**
1. Business profit + Other income = Total income
2. Minus tax reliefs = Taxable income
3. Apply progressive tax brackets = Tax owed
4. Net cash = Profit - Tax

### Tax Brackets (YA 2024/2025)

Malaysia uses **progressive tax brackets**. This means:
- First RM5,000: 0% tax (free money!)
- Next RM15,000 (RM5k-RM20k): 1% tax
- Next RM15,000 (RM20k-RM35k): 3% tax
- And so on...

**Full brackets:**

| Income Range (RM) | Tax Rate |
|-------------------|----------|
| 0 - 5,000 | 0% |
| 5,001 - 20,000 | 1% |
| 20,001 - 35,000 | 3% |
| 35,001 - 50,000 | 6% |
| 50,001 - 70,000 | 11% |
| 70,001 - 100,000 | 19% |
| 100,001 - 250,000 | 25% |
| 250,001 - 400,000 | 26% |
| 400,001 - 600,000 | 28% |
| Above 600,000 | 30% |

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** RM150,000 business profit, RM24,000 reliefs

1. **Total income**: RM150,000
2. **Minus reliefs**: RM150,000 - RM24,000 = RM126,000 taxable income
3. **Calculate tax**:
   - RM0-RM5,000: 0% = RM0
   - RM5,001-RM20,000: 1% = RM150
   - RM20,001-RM35,000: 3% = RM450
   - RM35,001-RM50,000: 6% = RM900
   - RM50,001-RM70,000: 11% = RM2,200
   - RM70,001-RM100,000: 19% = RM5,700
   - RM100,001-RM126,000: 25% = RM6,500
   - **Total tax = RM15,900**
4. **Net cash**: RM150,000 - RM15,900 = **RM134,100**

### Tax Reliefs

**Default reliefs** (what most people get):
- Basic relief: RM9,000 (everyone gets this)
- EPF/Life Insurance: RM7,000 (combined max)
- Medical: RM8,000
- **Total: RM24,000**

**Other reliefs** (if applicable):
- Spouse relief: RM4,000 (if spouse has no income)
- Children relief: RM2,000 per child (varies by age)
- Education/Medical (children): RM8,000 per child

**Pro tip:** More reliefs = less tax = Enterprise becomes more attractive.

## Corporate Tax (Sdn Bhd)

### How It Works

If you're an Sdn Bhd, the **company** pays tax on its profit, then you pay personal tax on what you take out (salary + dividends).

**The Process:**
1. Company profit - Salary - Employer EPF = Company taxable profit
2. Company pays corporate tax on taxable profit
3. Post-tax profit can be distributed as dividends
4. You pay personal tax on salary
5. Dividends are mostly tax-free (YA 2025: 2% on excess >RM100k)
6. Net cash = Salary after EPF + Dividends - Personal tax - Compliance costs

### SME Corporate Tax Brackets

**For companies with:**
- Revenue < RM50 million
- Meeting shareholding requirements (usually 100% Malaysian-owned)

| Profit Range (RM) | Tax Rate |
|-------------------|----------|
| 0 - 150,000 | 15% |
| 150,001 - 600,000 | 17% |
| Above 600,000 | 24% |

**Important:** These are **SME rates**. If your company doesn't qualify, you pay 24% flat rate (ouch).

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** RM150,000 profit, RM5,000/month salary, RM5,000 compliance costs

1. **Annual salary**: RM5,000 × 12 = RM60,000
2. **Employer EPF** (13% of RM60k): RM7,800
3. **Company taxable profit**: RM150,000 - RM60,000 - RM7,800 = RM82,200
4. **Company tax** (15% on first RM150k): RM82,200 × 15% = RM12,330
5. **Post-tax profit**: RM82,200 - RM12,330 = RM69,870
6. **Dividends**: RM69,870 (assumed fully distributed)
7. **Dividend tax**: RM0 (under RM100k threshold)
8. **Employee EPF** (11% of RM60k): RM6,600
9. **Salary after EPF**: RM60,000 - RM6,600 = RM53,400
10. **Personal tax on salary**: RM53,400 - RM24,000 reliefs = RM29,400 taxable → ~RM3,500 tax
11. **Compliance costs**: RM5,000
12. **Net cash**: RM53,400 + RM69,870 - RM3,500 - RM5,000 = **RM114,770**

**Result:** Enterprise wins by ~RM19,000 per year at this profit level.

### When Sdn Bhd Wins

Sdn Bhd becomes attractive when:
- **Higher profit** (RM300k+): Lower corporate tax rate (15-17%) beats personal tax (25-30%)
- **Need limited liability**: Protect personal assets
- **Want EPF benefits**: Salary contributions to EPF
- **Planning to scale**: Easier to get investors, loans, etc.

## EPF Contributions

### Employer EPF

The company pays this (it's a cost to the company):

- **Salary ≤ RM5,000/month**: 13% of salary
- **Salary > RM5,000/month**: 12% of salary

**Example:** RM5,000/month salary
- Annual salary: RM60,000
- Employer EPF: RM60,000 × 13% = RM7,800/year

### Employee EPF

You pay this (deducted from your salary):

- **11%** of salary (always)

**Example:** RM5,000/month salary
- Annual salary: RM60,000
- Employee EPF: RM60,000 × 11% = RM6,600/year
- Take-home salary: RM60,000 - RM6,600 = RM53,400/year

**Note:** EPF is good for retirement, but it reduces your immediate cash flow.

## Dividend Tax (YA 2025)

Starting Year of Assessment 2025, dividends have a new rule:

- **Dividends ≤ RM100,000**: Tax-free (as before)
- **Dividends > RM100,000**: 2% tax on the **excess**

**Example:** RM150,000 dividends
- First RM100,000: Tax-free
- Excess RM50,000: 2% = RM1,000 tax
- **Total dividend tax: RM1,000**

**Why this matters:** If you're taking large dividends from your Sdn Bhd, you'll pay this tax. It reduces the Sdn Bhd advantage at higher profit levels.

## Audit Exemption

Private companies can skip audits if **ALL** of these are true:

1. **Revenue ≤ RM100,000**
2. **Total assets ≤ RM300,000**
3. **≤ 5 employees**

**If you exceed ANY of these**, you need an audit. Audits cost RM3,000-8,000 per year (typical).

**Why this matters:** Audit costs eat into your Sdn Bhd savings. If you qualify for exemption, Sdn Bhd becomes more attractive.

## The Crossover Point

The **crossover point** is the profit level where Enterprise and Sdn Bhd give you the same net cash.

**Below crossover:** Enterprise wins (simpler, less compliance costs)
**Above crossover:** Sdn Bhd wins (lower tax rates)

**Typical crossover:** Around RM200k-300k profit, depending on:
- Your salary level
- Compliance costs
- Audit requirements
- Tax reliefs

The calculator shows this visually in the crossover chart.

## Common Gotchas

### Gotcha 1: Compliance Costs Are Real

Sdn Bhd has real costs:
- Company secretary: RM1,500-3,000/year
- SSM fees: RM500-1,000/year
- Tax agent: RM1,500-3,000/year
- Audit (if required): RM3,000-8,000/year

**Total: RM3,000-15,000/year** (realistic range)

Don't ignore these. They matter.

### Gotcha 2: Salary Can't Be Too High

You can't pay yourself RM100k salary from a RM150k profit company. That doesn't make sense.

**Rule of thumb:** Salary shouldn't exceed 80% of profit. The calculator validates this.

### Gotcha 3: EPF Relief Uses Default

The calculator uses RM7,000 EPF relief (default), not your actual EPF contributions. This is a simplification.

If you contribute more than RM7,000 to EPF, you get more relief. But we use the default for simplicity.

### Gotcha 4: Full Dividend Distribution

We assume you distribute **all** post-tax profit as dividends. In reality, you might keep some in the company.

If you keep profit in the company, you pay less dividend tax, but you also have less cash now.

### Gotcha 5: SME Qualification Not Verified

We assume your company qualifies for SME tax rates. But you need to:
- Have revenue < RM50 million
- Meet shareholding requirements (usually 100% Malaysian-owned)

If you don't qualify, you pay 24% corporate tax (not 15-17%). That changes everything.

## Accuracy Disclaimer
